# jQuery
In this program, I animate a New York City jigsaw puzzle using jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
I created this puzzle during my NYU Fall 2016 Web Design class.
When the First Puzzle page loads, the pieces of the puzzle are distrbuted around the page. All but one piece move to their final
"solved" position except for one piece. That final piece is controlled by four buttons: Up, Down, Left, and Right. These buttons are
implemented with jQuery menu. Each of these buttons moves the puzzle piece a small distance. The jQuery "animate" function is used
to solve this puzzle. The Second Puzzle page solves the same puzzle, but this time the user drags all the pieces to their final position.
It uses the jQuery UI "draggable" function.
